# *Designing Kohonen self organizing map SOM from scratch*

## Overview

-   Designed a Kohonen self organizing map (SOM), which gives as an output some shades of color mapped over 100 by 100 grid of neurones
-   The training input of the SOM are 24 colors (use shades of red, green, blue, with some
yellow, teal and pink) which is chosen from the "RGB Color Table: Basic Colors" section of this page:
http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm
-  Generated a figure of the original grid (random weights) followed by figures of the SOM after 20, 40, 100, 1000 epochs while changing the value of Ïƒ = 1, 10, 30, 50, 70.
